Puzzle platformer where the player has to hit keys in order that play a scale
When the player hits the last note the descending part of the scale plays as the viewport zooms in to the player with the UI for the next level
If a key is played in the wrong order or the play hits a killing obstacle all notes play at once jarringly and the player is returned to the level start
