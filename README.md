# About

This is my submission to the GitHub [Game Off 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) game jam.

I joined the game jam as motivation to learn Godot so fair warning there will be plenty of dead ends and poor practice in this repo.

# Build

This is a Godot 4 project, developed in version 4.1.3. Older revisions were developed in C#, then later converted to GDScript to support web export. The repo should include everything outside of Godot required to build.
